# RoboRTSScript
A script to install ROS Kinetic Desktop and RoboRTS from DJI on a clean installation. Might be useful if you need to set up multiple enviroments at the same time. 

## How to use?
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/senyig20/RoboRTSScript/master/install.sh && sudo bash ./install.sh %NAME_CATKIN_WS% %NAME_ROS_DISTRO_LOWERCASE%
```
Modify  %NAME_CATKIN_WS% and %NAME_ROS_DISTRO_LOWERCASE% to your taste. 

PS: While this script is tested on AWS servers and is working, there is absolutely NO GUARANTEE whatsoever. Use at your own risk.
